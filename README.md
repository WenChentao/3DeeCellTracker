# 3DeeCellTracker

This pipeline was designed for segmenting and tracking cells in 3D + T images in deforming organs. The methods have been explained in Wen et al. bioRxiv 2018 (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/385567) and in another paper during revision. 
The data for demonstration and the previous demo codes can be found in: http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/set/20190602/
