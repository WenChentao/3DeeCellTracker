    "# 3DeeCellTracker Demo: Train FlexiblePointMatcher with a .csv file\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how to train a neural network called FlexiblePointMatching for 3D cell tracking. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, you can download the \"worm3_points_t1.csv\" file from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/WenChentao/3DeeCellTracker/blob/master/Examples/use_stardist/worm3_points_t1.csv. This file will be used throughout the notebook to showcase the FFN training process. Alternatively, you can generate your own 3D cell coordinates in a .csv file to train your own model.\n",

    "- A. Import packages\n",
